# Haplotype Map JS
A library for visualizing haplotype data in the form a colored matrix.

## Goal

This fork is **focused on settings to make this web-app compatible with Drupal/Tripal**. All credit for this web application should remain with the original developers: Venkat Bandi in Dr. Carl Gutwin's Human Computer Interaction Lab at the University of Saskatchewan.
