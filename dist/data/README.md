 - AGILE-Activity2
    - genotypic data was exported using the VCF Bulk Export as Hapmap by selecting "AGILE LDP Exome Capture SNP Set" aligned to	"Lc2.0" with "578,890 SNPs". No filtering was done.
    - phenotypic data was downloaded from experiment 128 using the `export_AP_phenotypes.drush.php` data script in this module (all germplasm and numeric traits).
